TestVagrant is looking to hire a good number of technically smart people to grow their team of full stack QAs.
To meet the demand, they are conducting lot of interviews in house on a regular basis.
The recruitment team stores all the data for candidates that come for interviews (stuff like name, experience,
organization, interview date, selected or not etc.) . We want to use this data to get a better insight into the
overall process and realign recruitment effort in the right direction.
Write a program to calculate the following data for a given date range.
